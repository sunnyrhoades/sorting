'''
Python provides built-in sort/sorted functions that use timsort internally.
You cannot use these built-in functions anywhere in this file.

Every function in this file takes a comparator `cmp` as input which controls how the elements of the list should be compared against each other.
If cmp(a,b) returns -1, then a<b;
if cmp(a,b) returns  1, then a>b;
if cmp(a,b) returns  0, then a==b.

    Merge sort is the standard O(n log n) sorting algorithm.
    Recall that the merge sort pseudo code is:

            it is sorted, so return xs
        else
            divide the list into two halves left,right
            sort the left

    You should return a sorted version of the input list xs

def quick_sorted(xs, cmp=cmp_standard):
    '''
    Quicksort is like mergesort,
    but it uses a different strategy to split the list.
    Instead of splitting the list down the middle,
    a "pivot" value is randomly selected, 
    and the list is split into a "less than" sublist and a "greater than" sublist.

    The pseudocode is:

        if xs has 1 element
            it is sorted, so return xs
        else
            select a pivot value p
            put all the values less than p in a list
            put all the values greater than p in a list
            sort both lists recursively
            return the concatenation of (less than, p, and greater than)

    You should return a sorted version of the input list xs
    '''
    less = []
    pivot_list = []
    more = []

        for i in xs:
            if i < pivot:
                less.append(i)
            elif i > pivot:
                more.append(i)

                pivot_list.append(i)
        less = quick_sorted(less)
        more = quick_sorted(more)
        return less + pivot_list + more

    EXTRA CREDIT:
    The main advantage of quick_sort is that it can be implemented in-place,
    i.e. with O(1) memory requirement.
    Merge sort, on the other hand, has an O(n) memory requirement.

    Follow the pseudocode of the Lomuto partition scheme given on wikipedia
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Algorithm)
    to implement quick_sort as an in-place algorithm.
    You should directly modify the input xs variable instead of returning a copy of the list.
